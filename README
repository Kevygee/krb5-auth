Ruby bindings for the Kerberos library

This is an implementation of Ruby bindings for the Kerberos library, loosely
based off of the implementation here: https://rubyforge.org/projects/krb5-auth/

To build a gem, you'll want to:

$ gem build krb5-auth.gemspec
# gem install krb5-auth-0.4.gem

To build an RPM, you'll want to:

$ gem build krb5-auth.gemspec
$ gem2rpm -s -t ruby-krb5-auth.spec krb5-auth-0.4.gem
$ rpmbuild --rebuild rubygem-krb5-auth-0.4-1.fc8.src.rpm (note that you might
have to pass --define="__arch_install_post %{nil}" to skip some check-buildroot
errors)

And then install the resulting RPM.

To build it just for development, you'll want to:
$ cd ext
$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make

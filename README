Ruby bindings for the Kerberos library

This is an implementation of Ruby bindings for the Kerberos library.

To build a gem, you'll want to:

$ gem build krb5-auth.gemspec
# gem install krb5-auth-{VERSION}.gem

To build an RPM, you'll want to:

$ gem build krb5-auth.gemspec
$ gem2rpm -s -t rubygem-krb5-auth.spec krb5-auth-{VERSION}.gem
$ rpmbuild --rebuild rubygem-krb5-auth-{VERSION}-{RELEASE}.fc8.src.rpm

and then install the resulting RPM.

To build it just for development, you'll want to:
$ cd ext
$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make
